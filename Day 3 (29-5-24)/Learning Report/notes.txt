Day 3

Notes from react.dev learnings

Component:
reusable ui elements
React component is a JavaScript function that you can sprinkle with markup
React components are regular JavaScript functions, but their names must start with a capital letter or they wonâ€™t work!
useful notes:
- use parantheses after return statement
- export default lets other functions know the main part of the component
- never define component inside other components (don't nest them)
instead, do a top definition and pass it using props


In a React app, every piece of UI is a component.
recap:
React components are regular JavaScript functions except:

    Their names always begin with a capital letter.
    They return JSX markup.

note: even the root file is a component and is exported to index.js

IMPORTING AND EXPORTING Components
exporting and importing components help react make its component more reusable and dynamic.
there are two types of exports:
- named exports - 
- default exports

both exports define how imports are to be made
named export can be done as many times as possible whereas default exports can only be done once per component
the syntax of both the exports:
* named export:
exporting syntax: export function Hello(){
    ....
}

importing syntax: 
import { Hello } from "Hello component file path"

* default exports:
exporting syntax: export default function Hey(){
    .....
}

importing syntax:
import Hey from "Hey component file path"

some key points to remember:
if you want to export multiple components from a single file, you should use named exports as there can only be a single default export
so default export is used to export a single component

WRITING MARKUP WITH JSX
