rules in hooks:
only call hooks at top level
- dont call hooks inside loops, conditions

only call hooks from react functions
- call them from within react functional components and not just any regular javascript function


SUMMARY USESTATEHOOK:
the useState hook lets you add state to functional components
in classes, the state is always an object
with the useState hook, the state doesn't have to be an object
the useState hook returns an array with 2 elements
the first element is the current value of the state, and the second element is a state setter function 
IMPORTANT:
    - when dealing with objects or arrays, always make sure to spread your state variable and then call the setter function
