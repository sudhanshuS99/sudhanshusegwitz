hooks: features which allow you to use react features without having to write a class
hooks dont work inside a class.
why hooks?
reason set 1:
- complexity of this keyword
- remember to bind event handlers in class components
- classes don't minify very well and make hot reloading very unreliable

reason set 2:
no particular way to reuse stateful component logic
NEED TO SHARE A USEFUL LOGIC IN A BETTER WAY

reason set 3:
create components for complex scenarios such as data fetching and subscribing to events
related code is not organized in one place
unrelated code in one place
because of stateful logic, can't break into smaller components

NOTE: CAN'T USE HOOKS INSIDE A CLASS components
