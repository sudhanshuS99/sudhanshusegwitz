react form handling:
controlled components: 
form elements whose value is controlled by react

step for creation of controlled component:
step 1: create a state that will control the input value 
step 2: handle onchange event handler

note: since its an older tutorial, using class components to demonstrate forms
will update with useState Hook shortly
