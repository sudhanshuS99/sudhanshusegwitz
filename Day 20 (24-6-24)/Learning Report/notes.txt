1. form state:
every form has a few moving parts that keep changing from time a user loads the form to the time they submit it

- current value of every field in the form
- whether a field has been interacted with
- whether a field's value has changed
- whether a field is invalid
- whether a field contains errors

in code, it can be represented as an object with key value pairs

2. form validation:

- required
- minLength & maxLength
