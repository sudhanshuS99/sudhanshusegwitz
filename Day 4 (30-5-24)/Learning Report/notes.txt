MARKUP IN JSX:
jsx is a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows developers to write HTML-like code inside a JavaScript file.
the need for jsx:
as the logic grows, the entanglement of html and js provides conciseness and better handling
the rules of jsx:
1. return a single root component
- use a single fragment tag on all the elements that are present

2. close all the tags:
- no tags must be left open (jsx has stricter rules than html)

3. camelCase most of the elements

special notes:
    1. JSX attributes inside quotes are passed as strings.
    2. Curly braces let you bring JavaScript logic and variables into your markup.
    3. They work inside the JSX tag content or immediately after = in attributes.
    4. {{ and }} is not special syntax: itâ€™s a JavaScript object tucked inside JSX curly braces.

you can use curly braces effectively to produce jsx syntax which combines logic and content
